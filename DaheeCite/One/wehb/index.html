 <h1 >THE 'RONA IS HERE.</h1>

  <p>
    COVID-19 is a big ass storm and it's made of shit. 
    <br> For the past couple weeks, there has been a lot on my mind.
    </p>

    <a class = "blinking">
      How did this happen?
      </p>


      <a class = "blinkingOne">
        Are people still hiring?
        </p>


        <a class = "blinkingTwo">
          Is graduation happening on Zoom now?
          </p>


          <a class = "blinkingThree">
            How long is this gonna last?
            </p>


            <a class = "blinkingOne">
              When will I see <br> my friends again?
              </p>
              
              
              
    <a class = "blinkingTwo">
      Are things improving?
          </p>

    
          <a class = "blinking">
            What's gonna happen next?
            </p>         
 <p>
It's been difficult to find my groove, my jive, <br>and my optimistic
glass-half-full attitude.
</p>

<p style="text-align: right">
  What was supposed to be<br> my fresh first step into adulthood 
  is paused, <br>and there's no definitive start in sight.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: center; padding-top: 30px;padding-bottom: 120px;">
    All I know is <br> <em style = "font-size: 40px">my start is going to be 
    different.</em>
    </p>

  
    <p>
      Everything from
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: left;font-size: 45px;">
        greetings,
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;font-size: 45px;margin-left: 60px;">
          travelling,
          </p>

          <p style="text-align: left;font-size: 45px;margin-left: 170px;">
            shopping,
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: left;font-size: 45px;margin-left: 240px;" >
              and even 
              </p>

    <p style="text-align: left;margin-left: 240px;font-size: 45px;">
      my identity as an Asian American
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: right;font-size: 45px;margin-left: 400px;">
        is going to look and<br> feel different.
        </p>

        <div class = "huv">
  <p style = "text-align:right;"> Every time I figure one thing out</p>
</div>
   <p class = "appear" style="text-align: right;font-size: 55px;">something else comes up and</p> 

   <p style = "text-align:right;">
    my future is still unclear.
    </p>

    <p style = "text-align: center;">
      I've been working on creating a space for myself.<br>
     The amount of relief and luck I feel about having a stable space to 
     self-quarentine is a blessing, but it hasn't been easy by any means. 
    </P>

    <div class = "box">
     <P style = "text-align: justify;"> <span style = "font-size: 23px;">I feel claustrophobic. </span>
     <span style = "font-size: 28px;">The walls are thin and the doors hide </span><span style = "font-size: 24px;"></span>nothing. I feel like every thought
     I dare to speak out loud is <span style = "font-size: 35px;" >amplified around <span style = "font-size: 40px;" >this house and every little </span><span style = "font-size: 45px;" >choice</span> 
      I make is on display for all to see.</span> I can't even cook the food I want without someone coming and 
      insisting on choking me of my adult independence and lurking and leering at what i'm doing. 
      I can't even express that I want a glass of water without four different pairs of hands asking 
      oh waht cup where like just leave me the fuck alone. Or I decide to cook something in the kitchen
      and all of a sudden she needs to be in the kitchen doing dishes or
      suddenly deciding to take inventory of the fridge. I have no space, no freedom, no privacy. 

      The worst part is everyone is at their worst. Everyone feel stuck, everyone feels negative,
      and everyone feels hopeless and useless. The connections we depend on to fuel and sustain
      our existence are no longer viable and everyone is left to fend for themselves. 

    </div>
    <P style = "text-align: center;">
    It might just be all in my head, but it's still real in my
     realm of existence. 
      </p>

      <P>
        I want to get control over my life. <br>
        I want to see my friends again, <br>
        go to the bookstore and browse for hours,<br>
        eat whatever food fits into my budget,<br>
        hang out with my partner in crowded Chinatown,<br>
        buy groceries and not stand in a weird line,<br>
        ride the subway without masks and gloves,<br>

      </P>
      <p style = "text-align: center; padding-bottom: 30px;">
        <em>but I know that all of these things are going to be different.</em>
      </p>
    
      <P>
        what's gotten me out of this hole isnt panicking, 
        applying to jobs, 
        trying to fix my website, 
        but the freedom of time i've allowed myself. 
      </P>

          
      <P>
        As stuff piles on I feel better.
      </P>
