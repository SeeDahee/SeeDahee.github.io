 <h1 >THE 'RONA IS HERE.</h1>

  <p>
    COVID-19 is a big ass storm and it's made of shit. 
    <br> For the past couple weeks, there has been a lot on my mind.
    </p>

    <a class = "blinking">
      How did this happen?
      </p>


      <a class = "blinkingOne">
        Are people still hiring?
        </p>


        <a class = "blinkingTwo">
          Is graduation happening on Zoom now?
          </p>


          <a class = "blinkingThree">
            How long is this gonna last?
            </p>


            <a class = "blinkingOne">
              When will I see <br> my friends again?
              </p>
              
              
              
    <a class = "blinkingTwo">
      Are things improving?
          </p>

    
          <a class = "blinking">
            What's gonna happen next?
            </p>         
 <p>
It's been difficult to find my groove, my jive, <br>and my optimistic
glass-half-full attitude.
</p>

<p style="text-align: right">
  What was supposed to be<br> my fresh first step into adulthood 
  is paused, <br>and there's no definitive start in sight.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: center">
    All I know is <br> <em>my start is going to be 
    different.</em>
    </p>

  
    <p>
      Everything from

      <p style="text-align: left;font-size: 45px;">
        greetings,

            shopping,
            </p>

            <p>
              and even 
              </p>

    <p style="text-align: center;font-size: 45px;">
      my identity as an Asian American
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: right;font-size: 45px;margin-left: 400px;">
        is going to look and<br> feel different.
        </p>

        <div class = "huv">
  <p style = "text-align:right; padding-bottom: 20px;"> Every time I figure one thing out</p>

   <p class = "appear" style="text-align: right;font-size: 45px;margin-left: 400px;">something else comes up and</p> 

   <p>
    my future is still unclear.
