          <em> I'm a creative technologist</em><br>
        <em>and community organizer.</em> 
     
      <br>  That means that I make and design stuff through coding and technology, 
      and I help communities come together, voice needs, and accomplish goals through events, campaigns, 
       mutual aid, workshops, and any other way that best suits the community.

      </p>
      <p class = "materials">
       I love to explore new ways to teach, learn, and research through activist research, participatory design, and civic action.
