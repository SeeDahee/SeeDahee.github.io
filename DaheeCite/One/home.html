          I'm a  <em>design technologist,</em>
        <em>design strategist,<br> and community organizer.</em> 
     
      <br>  That means that I make stuff through coding and technology, I plan the best way to design things, 
      <br>  and I help communities accomplish goals and voice opinions through events, campaigns, 
      <br>  protests, workshops, and any other way that best suits the community.

      </p>
      <p class = "materials">
       I love to explore new ways to teach, learn,<br> and research through activist research, participatory design, and community outreach.
