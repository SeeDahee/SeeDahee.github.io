    <mark>DESIGNER STATEMENT</mark>

  </h1>


  <p class="material">

    This is my designer statement <br><em>translated into braille</em> and<em> lasercut into wood.</em> 
  </p>



  <h2>
    <mark>INCLUSIVITY</mark>
  </h2>

  <p class="material">
    Inclusivity is a core value of mine. <br>
    Through this translation, I wanted to highlight that <br><em>anyone can make design accessible.</em>
  </p>

  <h2>
    <mark>PROCESS</mark>
  </h2>

  <p class="material">
    It was not a simple process to create this. <br>
    To create the lasercut file, I worked in <em>Adobe Illustrator</em> to create 
    the vector file. To my shock, <em>there was no standard braille font embedded into the program.</em><br>
    Through trial and error, I used an <em>online third party translator </em>to create a digital translation, <br>
    then verified the translation by asking <br><em>individuals who identified with blindness to read my statement out loud.</em>
  </p>

    </p>
  <p class="outcome">

    With this manifestation, I am not only demonstrating inclusive design, but I am also making a statement.
    <br><em>This is what inclusivity in design looks like.
    <br> As a designer, I will not accept design that does not include everyone.
    <br> Design is not good unless it encompasses all.</em>
