  <p class="point">

    This was a project that I participated in along with two other fellow students. We created
    an <em> organized webpage </em>of Parsons electives that catered to student's needs.

  <p class="outcome">

    A universal gripe among Parson students is the <em> poor navigation and accessability </em>of the school's
    course catalog. We decided to <em>challenge and solve</em> this design problem by re-designing how the
    course catalog would be layed out. We focused on <eM>electives</eM> because those were the primary conerns
    acording to a survery of students.
