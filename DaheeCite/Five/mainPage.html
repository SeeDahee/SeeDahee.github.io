    <p class = "point">

        Interruption is a collection of <em>temporary cardboard barriers</em> created
        to <em>observe how busy NYC commuters would interact with obstacles.</em>
        Annoying and meddlesome, the barriers transformed the commuter hub into
        a place of inconvenience.

<h3>
  <mark>CONCEPTUALIZATION</mark>
</h3>
  <p class = "point">

      <em>Irritance, inconvenience, and interruptions</em> are a commuter's worst enemy. Commuting is a time sensitive
      action, especially in NYC where public transportation has the potential to be better than its current state. 
      I wanted to play with this concept and observe how a change in flow would impact the commuters' 
      <em>paths, attitudes, and reactions.</em>

<h3>
    <mark>MATERIAL CHOICE</mark>
  </h3>


  <p class = "material">

      The use of a material that not only looks <em>flimsy</em> but is also weak in construction would
      create a different reaction than professional and more <em>permanent</em> barriers. The 
      relationship between the material's appearance and interaction was something I wanted to
      observe, as well as the interaction with the form itself.

      <mark>OUTCOMES</mark>
    </h3>
  
  
    <p class = "outcome">
  
      Most commuters were neither excited nor happy to see this installation in their path.
      Individuals either went out of their way to avoid it or found the easiest route through 
      the barriers; others behind them followed their path. My main observation was how 
      <em>people are respectful of borders, despite its appearance.</em> This project was not only 
      insightful, but also fun and humorous to create and execute.
