    THE COMMUNITY
  </p>
 

  <p class="side">
    Scope Of Work (SOW) is a <em>talent development agency for young BIPOC 
    creatives that establishes equity in the creative industry. </em>
    Our vision is to build a more inclusive creative ecosystem.
     We are at the intersection of racial justice and financial 
     equity for young BIPOC people ages 17 - 24 years old. SOW provides 
     Members with free creative and professional skill-building programming, 
     mentorship, and direct connections to paid creative opportunities.

  <p class = "headers">
   THE COLORING BOOK
  </p>


  <p class="side">

    The digital coloring book was created with the intention 
    to both motivate and inspire as society reimagines new systems 
    of support, new methods of problem-solving, and new ways to care 
    for one another in the wake of the global pandemic. Everyone was feeling disheartened and disempowered with the sudden loss of resources, partnerships, and sense of community.
    This coloring book was not only created for our supporters, but also as a means to get our creative juices running again and feel lifted and empowered by one another.
