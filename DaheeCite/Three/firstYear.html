    I worked on a team with Parsons First Year Administration and student and faculty
    from Washington Heights Expeditionary Learning School (WHEELS)
    to create <em>a communication system</em> within "crew"
    to facilitate the flow of information and ideas.

  </p>

  <h2>
    <mark>FIRST YEAR?</mark>
  </h2>
  <p class="material">

    First year is the foundation year for students that
    study at Parsons School of Design. Students are required to take core classes in
    subject matter covering 2D and 3d design, sustainability, and art history. 
    First year encompasses not only academics, but also <em>advising and student involvement. </em>

  <h2>
    <mark>RESEARCH METHODS</mark>
  </h2>


  <p class="material">

    We worked closely with the student and faculty at WHEELS to discover the
    values, goals, and needs of crew and WHEELS. Through <em>participatory research and
      collaboration</em>, we were able to discover that the crew program needed
    <em> faster and effcient communication among crews, school administration, and local communities.</em>

  <h2>
    <mark>OUTCOMES</mark>
  </h2>


  <p class="outcome">

    To test run our new system, the students created a campaign titled <em>Dear Betsy.</em> Students all
    designed and wrote postcards to the secretary of education, Betsey DeVos, to voice their opinions
    on a variety of issues such as guns in schools, facilities and their conditions, and much more.
