  <p class="point">
    The system put in place by WHEELS created
    <em>separation and little communication methods among individual crews.</EM>
    I worked on a team with other college students, and student and faculty
    from Washington Heights Expeditionary Learning School (WHEELS)
    to create <em>a communication system</em> within "crew"
    to facilitate the flow of information and ideas.

  </p>

  <h3>
    <mark>WHAT IS CREW?</mark>
  </h3>
  <p class="point">

    Crew is <em>a student support system</em> consisting of
    a group of 5 to 7 students and a teacher.
    Crew provides homework help,
    college application aids, and a general safe space</em> for students to feel
    welcomed and accepted.

  <h3>
    <mark>TEAMWORK</mark>
  </h3>


  <p class="material">

    We worked closely with the student and faculty at WHEELS to discover the
    values, goals, and needs of crew and WHEELS. Through <em>participatory research and
      collaboration</em>, we were able to discover that the crew program needed
    <em> faster and effcient communication among crews, school administration, and local communities.</em>

  <h3>
    <mark>OUTCOMES</mark>
  </h3>


  <p class="outcome">

    To test run our new system, the students created a campaign titled <em>Dear Betsy.</em> Students all
    designed and wrote postcards to the secretary of education, Betsey DeVos, to voice their opinions
    on a variety of issues such as guns in schools, facilities and their conditions, and much more.
