    <mark>BACKSTORY</mark>
   </p>
  <p class="material">

    I have always been passionate and outspoken with my stance on<mark><em> gentrification and erasure of culture. </em></mark>
    To see this happing live before me on an everyday basis made me <mark><em>angry, upset,</em></mark> and a deep sense
    of <mark><em>injustice.</em></mark> My friend, Daniel, and I would be on the L train and watch as <mark><em>people 
    with no knowledge of the origins of Williamsberg and/or the L train</em></mark>  would rave about this new "fusion food" 
    or this "awesome Chinese Korean sushi Bar with poke burritos" and it would frustrate us. We decided to 
    act on this, and curate a book with <mark><em>personal accounts, stories, feelings, and experiences</em></mark> on gentrification.

  <mark>RESEARCH</mark>
 </p>
<p class="material">

  As one native New Yorker <mark><em>(Queens is the best borough)</em></mark>, and one Urban Design student, we decided to approach this in a <mark><em>participatory</em></mark>
  manner, putting up flyers and posting a link to a submission on social media to reach those <mark><em>not only in our inner circle, 
  but those outside of it who have been impacted by the L Train.</em></mark>
