    This is a book that Daniel Chu and I are curating on 
    <em>gentrification</em> along the <em>L Train</em> located in Brooklyn, New York.

  <h2>
    <mark>BACKSTORY</mark>
  </h2>
  <p class="material">

    I have always been passionate and outspoken with my stance on<em> gentrification and erasure of culture. </em>
    To see this happing live before me on an everyday basis made me <em>angry, upset,</em> and a deep sense
    of <em>injustice.</em> My friend, Daniel, and I would be on the L train and watch as <em>people 
    with no knowledge of the origins of Williamsberg and/or the L train</em>  would rave about this new "fusion food" 
    or this "awesome Chinese Korean sushi Bar with poke burritos" and it would frustrate us. We decided to 
    act on this, and curate a book with <em>personal accounts, stories, feelings, and experiences</em> on gentrification.
</p>

<h2>
  <mark>RESEARCH</mark>
</h2>
<p class="material">

  As one native New Yorker <em>(Queens is the best borough)</em>, and one Urban Design student, we decided to approach this in a <em>participatory</em>
  manner, putting up flyers and posting a link to a submission on social media to reach those <em>not only in our inner circle, 
  but those outside of it who have been impacted by the L Train.</em>
