    <p class = "point">
      I worked on a team with other college students, and student and faculty 
      from Washington Heights Expeditionary Learning School (WHEELS)
      to create <em>a communication system within "crew" 
      to facilitate the flow of information and ideas.
    </em>
  </p>



<h3>
<mark>WHAT IS CREW?</mark>
</h3>
<p class = "point">

    Crew is <em>a student support system consisting of
    a group of 5 to 7 students and a teacher.</em>
    Some support systems crew provides are <em>homework help,
    college application aids, and a general safe space</em> for students to feel
    welcomed and accepted. This system put in place by WHEELS created 
    <EM>separation and little communication methods among individual crews.</EM>

<p class = "material">

  We worked closely with the student and faculty at WHEELS to discover the 
  values, goals, and needs of crew and WHEELS. Through <em>participatory research and 
  collaboration</em>, we were able to discover that the crew program needed 
  <em> faster and effcient communication among crews, school administration, and local communities.</em>

    To test run our new system, the students created a campaign titled <em>Dear Betsey.</em> Students all
    designed and wrote postcards to the secretary of education, Betsey DeVos, to voice their opinions 
    on a variety of issues such as guns in schools, facilities and their conditions, and much more.
