      The app consists of sleep tracking, guided meditations and breathing sessions, 
      sleep stories, and the ability to change the device's pulse settings. The user logs into the app with 
      their email and password, and their information is stored securely within that account. The app is 
      compatible with apple and android products and free for use.

       The Process
     </p>
 

    <p class = "side">
     We consulted with numerous sleep psycologists and neurologist to understand the needs of sleep deprived people. 
     My role was to lead user testing sessions once every three months with a wide variety of individuals.
