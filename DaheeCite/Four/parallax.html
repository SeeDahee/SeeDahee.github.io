      The installation requires at least two participants in order to 
      function in any manner. Without at least two participants, it will not exhibit any response to 
      interactions. Only when two people perform parallel actions does the 
      installation begin the experience and change states.

      The experience is create do foster a deeper sense of connection that surbasses any visual or verbal communication.
       The connection that is created should satisfy both individuals and create almost a euphoric and surreal emotion.

      The booth is about 4 feet high and emcases a person.
      In the center is a translucent acrylic panel intersected by four 
      panels which act as walls that separate the two participants. 
      On each of these wall panels are two interactive touch pads coated with 
      neoprene fabric which emit sound and vibration when pressed simultaneously
       by the users. The emitted sound is a digital, universally accepted tone that 
       creates a feeling of satisfaction when heard.
