      I created a <em>kinetic mask and projections </em>to express
      the difficulties of dealing with non-cathartic emotions.

  <mark>NON-CATHARTIC EMOTIONS</mark>
</h2>


<p class = "material">

    Non-cathartic emotions are <em>inconclusive feelings and thoughts such as loneliness, resentment,
    and depression.</em> These emotions that can't be projected or released are always lingering and
    always carried throughout life. Difficult yet withstanding emotions can be difficult to speak about
    and express in a verbal manner. <em>The mask controls the wearer</em> by opening and closing at
    random to visualize the difficulty of vocalizing the emotions.

  <p class = "material">

    The mask was created with paper mache and newspaper to replicate and visualize the 
    uncomfortable emotions and feelings that can build up. The movement of the mask was controlled
    by <em>arduino servo motors</em> attached to the inside of the mask. Projections were created in 
   <em>photoshop</em> and projected when an individual wore the mask.

    <mark>OUTCOMES</mark>
  </h2>


  <p class = "outcome">

    The mask and the projection's similar role of <em>convering and transforming</em> was an
    essential result from this study. The emergence of<em> a physicalization of a non-cathartic, 
    difficult to emote, abstract emotion</em> was important in understanding how thoughts and feelings 
    can manifest in an individual over time.
