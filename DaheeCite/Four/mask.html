    <p class = "point">
      Myself and two other collaborators worked together to create a <em>kinetic mask and projections </em>to express
      the difficulties of dealing with non-cathartic emotions.

  <mark>NON-CATHARTIC EMOTIONS</mark>

<p class = "material">

    Non-cathartic emotions are <em>inconclusive feelings and thoughts such as loneliness, resentment,
    and depression.</em> These emotions that can't be projected or released are always lingering and
    always carried throughout life. Difficult yet withstanding emotions can be difficult to speak about
    and express in a verbal manner. <em>The mask controls the wearer</em> by opening and closing at
    random to visualize the difficulty of vocalizing the emotions.

    The mask was created with paper mache and newspaper to replicate and visualize the 
    uncomfortable emotions and feelings that can build up. The movement of the mask was controlled 
    an <em>arduino server motor</em> attached to the inside of the mask. Projections were created in 
   <em>photoshop</em> and projected when an individual wore the mask.

    <mark>OUTCOMES</mark>
  </h3>


  <p class = "outcome">

    The mask and the projection's similar role of <em>convering and transforming</em> was an
    essential result from this study. The emergence of<em> a physicalization of a non-cathartic, 
    difficult to emote, abstract emotion</em> was important in understanding how thoughts and feelings 
    can manifest in an individual over time.
