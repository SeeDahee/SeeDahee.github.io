  <p class = "material">
      Cypher is a <em>decentralized, Internet of Things (IoT) system </em>
      that gives <em>agency and digital anonymity </em>to workers in <br>co-working spaces.

      <mark>ASSUMPTIONS</mark>
    </h2>
    
  <p class="material">

      In 2040, it is assumed that <em>data mining and surveillance are a prevalent issue,</em>
      making it increasingly tougher to protect the users anonymity as well as 
      information about who they are, where they are located and who they are working for. 
      <br>The project aims to <em>give agency back to the user</em> and <em>help them keep sensitive data private,</em> 
      and <em>create a streamlined environment, </em>which they are able to customize to their liking.

  <h2>
    <mark>HOW IT WORKS</mark>
  </h2>

  <p class = "material">
     Workspaces will be <em>unlocked via a physical key that houses a personal encrypted, ID token.</em> <br>
     When the user approaches their workspace within a larger coworking space (i.e. a desk), <em>their key sends an encrypted password to the IoT workspace system.</em> <br>
     When the IoT system receives the password <em>it sets workspace elements such as temperature, lighting, and seat specifications. </em><br>
    Cypher also unlocks the user's interface: a digital workspace removed from the big five, which allows for file creation, storing, and sharing.

  <p class = "material">
    To create the iOt, I used <em>RFM69 Breakout Boards</em> with an <em>Arduino</em> and connected the 
    serial outputs <br>
    to a node server. When the server recieves the key, the customized workspace is activated.
