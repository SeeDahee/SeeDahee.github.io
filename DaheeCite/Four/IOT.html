  <p class = "material">
      Cypher is a <mark><em>decentralized, Internet of Things (IoT) system </em></mark>
      that gives <mark><em>agency and digital anonymity </em></mark>to workers in <br>co-working spaces.

      In 2040, it is assumed that <mark><em>data mining and surveillance are a prevalent issue,</em></mark>
      making it increasingly tougher to protect the users anonymity as well as 
      information about who they are, where they are located and who they are working for. 
      <br>The project aims to <mark><em>give agency back to the user and helps them keep sensitive data private,</em></mark>
      and <mark><em>create a streamlined environment, </em></mark>which they are able to customize to their liking.

    <mark>HOW IT WORKS</mark>
  </p>

  <p class = "material">
     Workspaces will be <mark><em>unlocked via a physical key that houses a personal encrypted, ID token.</em></mark> <br>
     When the user approaches their workspace within a larger coworking space (i.e. a desk), <mark><em>their key sends an encrypted password to the IoT workspace system.</em></mark> <br>
     When the IoT system receives the password <mark><em>it sets workspace elements such as temperature, lighting, and seat specifications. </em></mark><br>
    Cypher also unlocks the user's interface: a digital workspace removed from the big five, which allows for file creation, storing, and sharing.

    To create the iOt, I used <mark><em>RFM69 Breakout Boards</em></mark> with an <mark><em>Arduino</em></mark> and connected the 
    serial outputs <br>
    to a <mark><em>node server.</em></mark> When the server recieves the key, the customized workspace is activated.
