      Cypher is a decentralized, Internet of Things (IoT) system 
      that gives agency and digital anonymity to workers in co-working spaces.

      ASSUMPTIONS

  <p class="side">

      In 2040, it is assumed that <em>data mining and surveillance are a prevalent issue,</em>
      making it increasingly tougher to protect the users anonymity as well as 
      information about who they are, where they are located and who they are working for. 
      The project aims to <em>give agency back to the user and helps them keep sensitive data private,</em>
      and <em>create a streamlined environment, </em>which they are able to customize to their liking.

    HOW IT WORKS
  </p>

  <p class = "side">
     Workspaces will be <em>unlocked via a physical key that houses a personal encrypted, ID token.</em> 
     When the user approaches their workspace within a larger coworking space (i.e. a desk), <em>their key sends an encrypted password to the IoT workspace system.</em>
     When the IoT system receives the password <em>it sets workspace elements such as temperature, lighting, and seat specifications. </em>
    Cypher also unlocks the user's interface: a digital workspace removed from the big five, which allows for file creation, storing, and sharing.

    To create the iOt, I used <em>RFM69 Breakout Boards </em>with an <em>Arduino</em> and connected the 
    serial outputs to a <em>node server.</em> When the server recieves the key, the customized workspace is activated.
