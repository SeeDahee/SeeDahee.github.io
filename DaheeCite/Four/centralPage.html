      This case study was an exporation of different dimetional creations of a topic.<br>
      I focused on <a href="/DaheeCite/Four/iderations/2d.html">2D</a>, <a href="/DaheeCite/Four/iderations/3d.html">3D</a> , and <a href="/DaheeCite/Four/iderations/interactive.html">Interactive</a> iderations.
      <p>
      My topic was LGBT issues, specifically coming out and the avaliability of choice.<br>
      I wanted to focus on this aspect specifically because it is more of a personal <br>
      issue that I could connect to more.

       <strong>Coming out isn't something everyone can do, despite security in their own sexuality.</strong> <br> 
        Complications such as family issues, social setting, and other factors can delay this<br>
        step or even make in unaccespible for an individual to come out to everyone or anyone.
