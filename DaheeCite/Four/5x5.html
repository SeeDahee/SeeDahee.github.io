        For five consecutive days, I randomely picked and illustrated a CitiBike station, and colored the image based
        off the number of bikes avaliable at the station.

      <em>Coming out is a privledge.</em> Since marriage equality in the USA passed in 
      2015, society has taken strides in accepting all sexual and gender identities. In our time
      of cultural, political, and societal turmoil, it's easy to forget that <em>respect is the foundation of acceptance.</em>
      I highlighted coming out as my central theme to <em> explore and emphasize the role of privledge in acceptance and progress.</em>

    <p class = "outcome">
      The works created from this study were not dark nor heavy. The results were opposite.
      A colorful vibrant card game, a soft friendly animal, and an illustrated comic all successfully 
      spread the reality of coming out. Not only did I gain insight into the struggles of coming out, but
      I also discovered that <em> heavy topics can be made approachable through design.</em>
