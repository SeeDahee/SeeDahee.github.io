    <mark>5 DAY STUDY</mark>

  </h1>


  <p class="point">

    For five consecutive days, I randomely picked and illustrated a Citi Bike station, and colored the illustration <em>based
      off the number of bikes avaliable at the station upon arrival. </em>

    <mark>CITI BIKE?</mark>
  </h3>
  <p class="point">

    <a href="https://www.citibikenyc.com/how-it-works" style="text-decoration: none">Citi bike</a>
    is a bikeshare service in New York City that's open for the public and citibike members to use.
    Reliability of public transportation in New York is something I wanted to explore, and Citibike
    was something I haven't researched.<em> Location, number of functioning bikes, and time of day</em> were key in the
    reliability
    of the service.

  <h3>
    <mark>OUTCOMES</mark>
  </h3>


  <p class="outcome">
    The repeated action and routine of doing this study deomstrated <em>the effectiveness of
      repetition.</em> The repeated and consecutive action of observing the same subject daily
    gave me more oppertunities to make new observations and catch details I could've missed the
    day before.
